FabricMC Community
==================

This repository contains documentation, bot tags and files used for orchestration. It's intended to be a one-stop-shop for our community and its services - in particular, Fabricord.

We'll update this README with more information later on, when we have some content.

If you're running a community and you like how we run ours, feel free to adapt our documents for your own use!
